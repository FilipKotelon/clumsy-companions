# Clumsy Companions

A whacky TCG adventure.

## Setup process

After opening a console in the root folder of the project (the one with package.json), run:

`npm install`

Then, to start the server, run:

`npm run start`

The application should then be available at localhost:4200 in your browser. Enjoy!
